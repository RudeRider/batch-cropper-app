üé¨ Digital Asset Tools: Batch Cropper & Frame Capture
This application bundles two powerful, client-side tools designed for efficient media asset preparation directly in your browser. All processing, including image manipulation, frame extraction, and ZIP compilation, is handled locally for speed and privacy.

‚ú® Application Structure
The interface uses a sticky header for quick tool switching and a responsive two-column layout on large screens:

Controls (Right Sticky Sidebar): Provides persistent access to file upload, global settings, and batch download buttons for the active tool, regardless of scroll position.

Tool Content (Left Area): Displays the working area, such as the Cropper Gallery or the Video Player.

üñºÔ∏è Tool 1: Batch Image Cropper
This tool streamlines the process of cropping multiple images to a specific aspect ratio or fixed pixel resolution.

üöÄ Batch Cropper Workflow
1. Upload Files (Sticky Sidebar): Drag-and-drop or select your PNG/JPEG images.

2. Set Global Settings (Sticky Sidebar): Define the default Aspect Ratio (e.g., 9:16) for all images.

4. Crop Gallery (Left Area): Review all images and use the local controls for granular adjustments.

3. Batch Download (Sticky Sidebar): Use the main button to download all processed images in a single ZIP file.
