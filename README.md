ðŸŽ¬ Digital Asset Tools (Self-Contained Browser Utility)
This is a single-file, three-in-one web application designed for fast, client-side manipulation and management of digital assets. Since the application runs entirely in your browser after initial loading, all processing is instant and secure.

1. Batch Cropper
The Batch Cropper allows you to upload multiple PNG or JPEG images and apply consistent or customized cropping settings across the entire set, then download the results as a single ZIP file.

Key Features:
Global Aspect Ratio: Set a single ratio (e.g., 16:9, 1:1, 9:16) that applies to all images, ensuring visual consistency across a batch of assets.

Custom Ratios & Free Crop: Define precise custom ratios or select "Free Crop" for flexible selection.

Global Output Resolution: Define a specific pixel width and height (e.g., 1920x1080) to force all cropped images to conform to a standard size.

Image Manipulation: Tools for rotating (90Â° clockwise) and flipping (horizontal) individual images within their cards.

Fill Empty Area: If the crop area is constrained by a required aspect ratio, you can choose a solid color to fill the background instead of allowing transparency.

Batch Download: Export all cropped and resized images into a single .zip file for efficient downloading.

How to Use:
Upload one or more images using the file input or drag-and-drop onto the upload zone.

In the Global Crop Settings sidebar, select your preferred default Aspect Ratio and Output Resolution.

For each image displayed in the Crop Gallery, drag the crop box to position it. You can override the global aspect ratio, output resolution, or fill color directly on the card if needed.

Click the "Download All Cropped Images (ZIP)" button to compile and download your batch.

2. Video Frame Capture
This tool lets you upload a video file and precisely capture still frames at any point, either manually or through an automated process.

Key Features:
Precise Seeking: Use the video player controls to move to the exact frame you wish to capture. The current time is displayed for reference.

Single Frame Capture: Capture the current frame as a PNG file instantly.

Auto-Capture Sequence: Specify a number of frames and an interval (in seconds) to automatically capture a sequence of images starting from the current video time.

Frame Management: Review captured frames in a gallery and delete any unwanted images.

Batch Download: Compile all captured PNG frames into a single .zip file.

How to Use:
Upload a video file (MP4, MOV, etc.) using the file input.

Use the video player controls to pause the video at the desired start time.

Click "Capture Frame" for a single image, or configure the inputs and click "Capture [X] Frames (Auto)" for a batch sequence.

Click "Download All Frames (ZIP)" to save your captured assets.

3. Simple Document Pad
The Document Pad is a simple, dark-themed rich text editor for writing notes, drafting content, or brainstorming, complete with basic formatting and character counting.

Key Features:
Rich Text Formatting: Apply Bold, Italic, and Underline formatting to your text using the toolbar buttons.

Live Metrics: Real-time word and character counts help track your progress.

Dark Theme: The editor pad uses a dark background and light text for comfortable long-duration writing.

HTML Export: Download your formatted content as a clean .html file, ensuring all text formatting is preserved when opening the document in any web browser or rich text application.

How to Use:
Click the formatting buttons (B, I, U) to apply styles to selected text.

Type directly into the pad area.

When ready, enter a desired file name (or use the default) and click "Download HTML" to save your document.
