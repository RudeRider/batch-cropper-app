üé¨ Digital Asset Tools (Batch Cropper & Video Frame Capture)
This is a comprehensive, single-file web application designed for fast, client-side manipulation of images and videos. It eliminates the need for server-side processing or external software by leveraging modern browser APIs, including the HTML5 Canvas, Cropper.js, and browser-based file utilities.

‚ú® Features
The application is split into two primary tools accessible via the header navigation:

1. Batch Cropper
The Batch Cropper allows users to upload multiple JPEG or PNG files and apply consistent or customized cropping rules across the entire batch before downloading them as a single ZIP file.

Feature

Description

Global Aspect Ratio

Set a default ratio (e.g., 16:9, 1:1, 9:16) that applies to all images.

Local Overrides

Override the global ratio, output resolution, output format (PNG/JPEG), and JPEG quality for individual images.

Visual Indicators

Each card displays a clear indicator showing whether the image is using the Global Default or a Local Override ratio.

Image Manipulation

Controls for Rotation (90¬∞ clockwise) and Horizontal Flipping are available on each card.

Resizing & Fill

Optionally set fixed output resolutions and define a solid fill color (default is white) if the cropped area doesn't match the required output dimensions.

Batch Download

Compiles all processed images into a single .zip file for efficient downloading using JSZip.

2. Video Frame Capture
This tool allows users to load a video file and extract high-quality still frames (PNG) at specific moments or in timed batches.

Feature

Description

Frame Extraction

Batch Capture

Automatically capture a user-defined number of frames at a set time interval (e.g., capture 5 frames every 0.5 seconds).
