Batch Image Cropper Gallery
A minimalist, client-side web application for batch cropping multiple PNG and JPEG images to a uniform aspect ratio or custom dimensions, with the added capability of filling transparent areas with a solid color.

This tool is designed for speed and efficiency, allowing users to upload up to 30 files, view them in an interactive gallery, apply global crop settings, and download all resulting cropped images in a single ZIP archive.

‚ú® Features
Batch Processing: Upload up to 30 PNG and JPEG files at once.

Interactive Gallery: View and manipulate all uploaded images simultaneously in a responsive grid.

Global Aspect Ratio Control: Instantly apply standard presets (16:9, 4:3, 1:1) or custom ratios to all images.

Free Crop Mode: Choose a "Free Crop" ratio (NaN) to allow independent, unrestricted cropping for each image.

Individual Manipulation: Fine-tune the position and scale of the crop box on each image using the Cropper.js interface.

Solid Color Fill: Automatically fill transparent areas (created by cropping outside the original image boundary) with a user-specified solid color (default: white).

Single-Click ZIP Download: All successfully processed images are compressed and downloaded as one convenient batch_cropped_images.zip file.

Single-File Application: The entire tool runs client-side, requiring no server setup or complex dependencies.
